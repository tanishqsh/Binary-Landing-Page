# Binary-Landing-Page
Binary Caves landing page which is designed exactly as the Business Card design of the company.

Hi,

Thanks for stopping by.

This is a landing page/maintenance page designed in respect to the similarly designed company business cards. Also, if you would like to fork the code, feel free too. But on usage, kindly mention the credits to Tanishq Sharma or Binary Caves.

Here is the landing page design: http://binarycaves.com/BusinessCardLandingPage
Here is the Card design from which it is inspired: http://binarycaves.com/BusinessCardDesign

Hope you like the code, make it amazing one. Next update, the enquiry buttons will have the modal installed.
